/**

    Following is the complete syntax of a Kotlin Property.

    var <propertyName>[: <PropertyType>] [= <property_initializer>]
    [<getter>]
    [<setter>]

    Getters and Setters are optional. Setters aren’t possible for a val property, since it is immutable.
    Classes in Kotlin can have properties.
    If a getter or setter isn’t defined, the default ones are used.
